## Overview

## My process

### How I approached it

I started by analyzing the Figma design to understand the structure, layout, and spacing. Then, I created a clean semantic HTML structure and styled it using custom CSS. I used Flexbox for alignment and spacing, followed a mobile-first approach, and carefully matched the design's colors, typography, and layout.
